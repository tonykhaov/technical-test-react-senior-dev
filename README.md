# Technical Test Senior React Developer

Build a galery app.

## Tasks

Given the following APIs:

- albums - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums
- users - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
- photos - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos

- 1. Display the list of all the albums with their title, their author name below and one photo for each as an
     illustration.
- 2. When clicking on an album, I should be redirected to another page to see the album details: the title, the author
     name, his email and the list of all the photos in the album.

- 3. I can filter the albums by the title with a search input and the search text should be persisted in the URL.

- 4. Write tests.

## Requirements

You are allowed to access docs, online contents, etc... everything but AIs.

UI is not so important. But I want you to give me at least your expertise on the UI and how things should be/look like.

You can use any libraries you want, only React is required. But this project comes with a few libraries already
installed and set up:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5)

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [MSW](https://mswjs.io/)
